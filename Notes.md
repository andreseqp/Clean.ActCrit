# To do list

* BayesianTools package apparently can be used with model code in other languages.
* How about changes in associability (alpha) bring about chunking!
* Check results of the attention mechanisms depending on whether updates affect
  only the critic, or the actor too

# Ideas to explore

## Influence of development in learning abilities. 
### Question:
Does the cognitive environment experienced during early development influence 
the capacity of individuals to learn certain a associations/preferences?
### Rationale:
Learning dynamics can be contingent on early experience (e.g. Blocking). What if
certain environments in early life favour decisions in the adult life?
### Tasks:
- Find a suitable optimal foraging model

## Influence of saliance dynamics on optimal foraging
### Question:
Which salience dynamics rules (e.g. Mckintosh, Pearce and Hall) favour 
decision-making in the context of optimal foraging?
### Rationale:
The way salience changes along learning can potentially favour finding 
associations that are adaptive in certain ecological contexts
### Tasks:
- Find a suitable optimal foraging model


## Sequencial addition of useful features
### Question:
How do cleaner fish improve their decision making by paying attention to 
new features/objects as the tune their decision making
