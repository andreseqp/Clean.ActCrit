## List of things to do

* Nrew does not seem to reach a stationnary distribution. Why?
* Need to run new simulations of the old estimates
* Radu recommended to change to likelihood calculation. Instead of calculating 
  the likelhood for each fish, calculate it for each location using the binomial
  distribution
