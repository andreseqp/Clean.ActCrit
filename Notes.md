## List of things to do

* Radu recommended to change to likelihood calculation. Instead of calculating 
  the likelhood for each fish, calculate it for each location using the binomial
  distribution. Took Radus suggestion.
* Using now gamma and beta distribution for perturbation of parameters
* To implement such distributions develop functions to calculate pdf and to 
  parametarize the distributions
* Developed new data file for using individual fish preferences rather than maerket 
  outcome
