## Introduction

Cooperation among individuals of the same or different species is ubiquitous in nature. 
Among individuals of the same species it is the basis for the evolution of  higher 
forms of biological organization [@maynardsmith_Major_1998]. 
Among individuals of different species it underlays the biological mechanism for 
fundamental ecological interactions such as pollination, nitrogen fixation or 
parasite removal [@begon_Ecology_2006]. However, when cooperation is costly, 
it is not straigtforward to understand why individuals would be willing to pay that cost [@lehmann_Evolution_2006]. Furthermore, cooperative interactions might open the way for 
one partner to exploit the other, what prevents this type of exploitation? [@herre_Evolution_1999]
One reason for cooperating is if the benefits obtained from a partner´s 
cooperative action are dependent on one's own cooperative act. 
This dependency can arise, for instance, when cooperative partners
choose who they interact with depending on the level of cooperation they offer. 
In line with this, cooperative interactions can be viewed as a market-like situation 
where partner choice mediates the level of exchange between traders [@hammerstein_Biological_2016; @leimar_Cooperation_2010; @noe_Biological_1994a]. Empirical evidence shows
that several iconic examples of cooperation between individuals of different species 
are indeed mediated by partner choice [@hammerstein_Biological_2016]. Biological market theory highlights 
that changes in the supply and demand of goods and services determines the value of 
those commodities, and therefore, can influence partner's actions in the cooperative 
exchange. For instance, in the marine cleaning mutualism, where cleaner fish 
_Labroides dimidiatus_ (cleaners) removes ectoparasites from other coral reef fishes (clients) [@cote_Evolution_2000],
some client species are able to choose among different cleaners, and because of this
obtain better service [@grutter_Cleaner_2003]. Better services means for clients to have priority when 
more than one client is available [@bshary_Choosy_2002], and less cheating (when cleaners eat live tissue
instead of parasites) [@grutter_Cleaner_2003]. However, recent evidence shows that when clients experience
ecological conditions with low cleaner abundance, they are less likely to use partner
choice to leverage better service [@triki_Biological_2019]. On the other side, 
cleaners in those markets with favourable conditions, stop giving priority to choosy clients [@triki_Biological_2019; @triki_Decrease_2018].
